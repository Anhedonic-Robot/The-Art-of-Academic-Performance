This guide is dedicated to someone close to me, in the hopes that they may survive the world of academia with grades high enough on their transcript to provide everything they could ever wish for. \\

To ensure the quality of this guide, version 1.0.0 will not be released until it has been tested and proven to allow someone to succeed in their academic goals. Any important update that includes the addition, revision or removal of any method outlined in this book will result in an increment of the middle digit and a reset to the last digit to zero. Lastly, any small changes, such as spelling revisions, will increment the last digit of the version number. Due to the strict time constraints of this project, a new version should be expected for release every Sunday.
