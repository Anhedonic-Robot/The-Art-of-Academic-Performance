This guide is dedicated to someone close to me, in the hopes that they may survive the world of academia with grades high enough on their transcript to provide everything they could ever wish for. \\

To ensure the quality of this guide, version 1.0.0 will not be released until it has been tested and proven to allow someone to succeed in their academic goals. Any important update that includes the addition, revision or removal of any method outlined in this book will result in an increment of the middle digit and a reset to the last digit to zero. Lastly, any small changes, such as spelling revisions, will increment the last digit of the version number. Due to the strict time constraints of this project, a new version should be expected for release every Sunday.

\chapter{The Art of Starting Strong}

School is not unlike a race. Instead of covering a set distance and optimizing for crossing the finish line in the shortest amount of time possible, one must cover as much course material as possible within a set amount of time. 

Like any race, it's important to prepare before your course even begins. Prior to starting your course, it's ideal that you've practiced managing your time and your finances effectively prior to starting your course. You should ideally also master the journaling method and all the study methods outlined below, and mastered the art of self study. If you haven't done any or all of the above, even after your course has already began, don't worry. the above is merely a description of the ideal. If you're already finished all of the above, you should be well on your way to getting excellent grades. 

\section{Checklist}

If your course has already started, it's important to get your affairs outside of school in order as soon as possible, so you can focus all your time and energy on academics. 

\begin{todolist}
