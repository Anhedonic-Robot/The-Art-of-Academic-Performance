\chapter{The Art of Starting Strong}

School is not unlike a race. Instead of covering a set distance and optimizing for crossing the finish line in the shortest amount of time possible, one must cover as much course material as possible within a set amount of time. 

Like any race, it's important to prepare before your course even begins. Prior to starting your course, it's ideal that you've practiced managing your time and your finances effectively prior to starting your course. You should ideally also master the journaling method and all the study methods outlined below, and mastered the art of self study. If you haven't done any or all of the above, even after your course has already began, don't worry. the above is merely a description of the ideal. If you're already finished all of the above, you should be well on your way to getting excellent grades.
